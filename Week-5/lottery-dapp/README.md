# ðŸŽ° Lottery dApp

## Overview
This project is a decentralized Lottery dApp that allows users to  

- Purchase and return lottery tokens  
- Approve tokens for betting  
- Place single or multiple bets  
- View lottery status and personal prizes  
- Claim winnings  
 
## The application is built using  
- **Scaffold-ETH 2** for the frontend interface  
- **Viem** for blockchain interactions  
- **MetaMask** for transaction signing  

## Project Goals

- Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Lottery smart contract  
- Implement token purchase, return, approval, and betting functionalities  
- Enable users to view lottery status and claim prizes  
- Ensure secure and efficient blockchain interactions using Viem and MetaMask  

## Implemented Features

### Frontend (Scaffold-ETH 2)

- **Token Management**: Users can purchase lottery tokens using ETH and return unused tokens  
- **Betting**: Users can place single or multiple bets after approving the required tokens  
- **Lottery Status**: Displays current lottery status, including whether bets are open, closing time, and total bets placed  
- **Prize Management**: Users can view their winnings and claim prizes directly from the interface  

### Blockchain Integration (Viem)

- **Contract Interactions**: Utilizes Viem's `publicClient` to read data from the Lottery smart contract  
- **Transaction Signing**: All write transactions are signed through MetaMask, ensuring secure user authentication and authorization
